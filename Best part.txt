Lyrics: You don't know, babe
        When you hold me
        And kiss me slowly
        It's the sweetest thing
        And it don't change
        If I had it my way
        You would know that you are
        You're the coffee that I need in the morning
        You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
        Won't you give yourself to me
        Give it all, oh...
